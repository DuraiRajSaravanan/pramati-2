SOLR
====

-   SOLR is used for developing,high performance search applications.
-   Can used in large data analysis, and can retrieve accurate results.
-   Use inverted index to search and providing results.
-   Inverted Index:- Takes all documents, splits them into words and
    then build and index for each word which will be usually document id
    where that word has been reffered.
-   Full-text searched application
-   Provide ranking based on keywords.
-   Why SOLR prefered over RDBMS
-   RDBMS not able to provide data based on relevance(eg:- searched for
    a name and instead providing the columns having that name\
    providing other rows having that word somewhere).
-   Stemming problem(there will be a root word and a stem).
-   RDBMS uses simple wild card searches,searches every table.

-   Why SOLR prefered over RDBMS?

1.  RDBMS not able to provide data based on relevance(eg:- searched for
    a name and instead providing the columns having that name\
    providing other rows having that word somewhere).
2.  Stemming problem(there will be a root word and a stem).
3.  RDBMS uses simple wild card searches,searches every table. \*Key
    features:-
4.  Advanced full-text search capabilities.
5.  Near Real-time indexing.
6.  Flexible and adaptable with easy configuration.
7.  Easy monitoring.
8.  Highly scalable and fault tolerant.
9.  Hit highlighting.

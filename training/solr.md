SOLR &gt;SOLR is used for developing,high performance search
applications. &gt;Can used in large data analysis, and can retrieve
accurate results. &gt;Use inverted index to search and providing
results. &gt;Inverted Index:- Takes all documents, splits them into
words and then build and index for each word which will be usually
document id where that word has been reffered. &gt;Full-text searched
application &gt;Provide ranking based on keywords. &gt;Why SOLR prefered
over RDBMS \* RDBMS not able to provide data based on relevance(eg:-
searched for a name and instead providing the columns having that name
providing other rows having that word somewhere). \* Stemming
problem(there will be a root word and a stem). \* RDBMS uses simple wild
card searches,searches every table. &gt;Installed SOLR

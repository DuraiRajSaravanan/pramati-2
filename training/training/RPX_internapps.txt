> Resolves patent related disputes.
> Non Practising Entities(NPE)- Group of companies which make profit from illegaal activities by simply filing a case against those who are using patents without license.
> RPX -They buy license from patent owners(either ownership or sublicense), save it in their databases and if any litigation related with patents occurs they support their registered clients so that cost and risk get reduced for the clients.
> Taking data from USPTO using PACER which can be in any format.

	3.Litigation - Cases or dispute on some patents
	4.Entity/aliases - Company/judges/lawyers or anyone involved in litigation


=>Internal Applications
> Main goal of internal app is to verify or validate the data from the external source(UPSTO) and delivered to insight applications.
> Four internal applications:
	1. Data Managing Application(DMA)
	2. Acquiflow 
	3. Member Credit
	4. Docblaster
1. DMA
* Focussed on verifying data based on litigation and aliases.
* Work flow- External source(USPTO-PACER) -> OCR -> cordDB -> DMA_app -> cordDb ->cortalDB -> Insight Application. 
* OCR processor extract the information related to plaintiff, descendant etc from the pdf file.
* The data obtained from OCR is given to cordDB from where it is given to DMA_app.
* In DMA_app all the corrections are made and also mapping between entities/aliases are done.
* Corrected data is send to cordDB again from after after performing ETL it is given to cortelDB.
* The final verified data is accessed by insight applications.
